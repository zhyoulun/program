- Goroutines是受了Coroutines的启发
- 两者区别:
  - Coroutines supports the explicit mean of transferring the control to other Coroutines
  - while Goroutines have it implicitly
- Goroutines比threads更轻量，because their creation and destruction are very cheap as compared to threads, and they are scheduled over OS threads.

## Goroutines vs threads

- 内存消耗低：Goroutines需要2kb，threads需要1Mb
- 创建和销毁代价低：threads需要向操作系统申请资源
- 切换代价低：
  - schedular do not directly talk to the OS kernel. When a Goroutine switch occurs, very few registers (say 3) like program counter and stack pointer need to be saved/restored.
  - thread: the schedular needs to save/restore all registers i.e. 16 general purpose registers, PC (Program Counter), SP (Stack Pointer), segment registers etc.

## 协程调度

- Processor (P)
- OSThread (M)
- Goroutines (G)
