TCP是基于字节流而不是消息包的协议，send和recv不保证是次数是对等的。

TCP保证消息有序性，如何转换成消息包，需要应用层来解决。

```
send(2) Upon successful completion, the number of bytes which were sent is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.
recv(2) These calls return the number of bytes received, or -1 if an error occurred.
```
